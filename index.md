## RSpec testing using Stubs, Mocks and Spies

RSpec is a testing tool written in Ruby. It is most frequently used testing library for Ruby production applications. In general while testing we can categorize the operations we do into 3 phases

1. #Arrange: Define the variable or instantiate the object required to perform the test
2. #Act: Use the desired methods on it
3. #Assert: Expect it to equal something which is expected of the entity which we are testing.
